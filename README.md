## Introduction
This project is a Python-based desktop application featuring a graphical user interface (GUI). It is designed to assist users in custom-building a PC by visually displaying the necessary components and tracking which parts the user already has. Built using a GUI framework/library such as tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy, the application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface. It aims to simplify the PC-building process, making it accessible and enjoyable even for non-technical users.
